A Jackass bearing relies seemed a lord,
Thought ’twas himself the gazing fools adored :
Thus a grave Square-toes he himself believed,
And hymns and prayers as his due received.
Some one his error soon found out, and said,
“Good Jack, through vanity you’re off your head ;
          It is the idol, and not you,
          To whom they think the homage due.”

Men honour not the donkey magistrate,
They make a leg but to his robe of state.

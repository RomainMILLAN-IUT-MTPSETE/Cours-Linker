A Vine, such as in certain climes is found,
Spreading robust and rising beyond bound,
Sheltered a stag from hunter and from hound.
          The hunter blamed the pack,
And gave the cry to bring them back.
Ingratitude ! The stag, from danger free,
Began to browse his kind protecting tree !
They heard, returned, and him dislodged again,
And left him dying on the plain.
“ I have deserved this punishment,” he cried,
“ Profit by it, ye ingrates ! ” ere he died.
The pack fell to, his tears were lost :
Hunters are deaf to pity as a post.

An image this of many of our kind,
Who violate the asylum that they find.

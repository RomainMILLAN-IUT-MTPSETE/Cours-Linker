A snake into a watch-shop crept one day‑
Bad neighbour for the watchmaker, I say‑
And searched the shop for food, but nothing saw,
Except a file, which he began to gnaw.
          The file thus very coolly spoke :
          “ Sure, silly little snake, you joke ;
          My solid substance you may bite,
          From me you’ll never gain a doit ;
          You’ll break your teeth upon the steel.
The tooth of time is all I fear or feel.”

This tale’s for you, ye wits of lowest class,
Who, good for nothing, bite at all that pass.
Ye torture your poor heads in vain,
To hiss at authors, or their merit stain.
To noble works you can no damage do,
They're brass, steel, diamonds to you.
